Cross-Platform Parking Lot Audit Mobile App (Replit Prompt)
Description: A cross-platform mobile web app (Progressive Web App) for performing parking lot audits at a hotel. This app enables staff to use their smartphone camera to scan vehicle license plates and automatically record parking data. The system leverages License Plate Recognition (LPR) technology and OCR to detect plate numbers, capturing both a cropped image of the plate and a full vehicle photo. Each audit entry logs the license plate text, images, GPS location, and timestamp of capture. All data is synced to a cloud backend (e.g. a Google Spreadsheet or a secure database) for further investigation, notes, and reporting. The goal is to streamline parking enforcement, improve accuracy, and maintain a digital record of all vehicles in the hotel lot, replacing manual checks with an efficient automated solution

Key Features and Requirements
License Plate Recognition (OCR): Utilize the phone’s camera and OCR to automatically detect and read license plate numbers from vehicle images. The app should highlight the plate in real-time and extract the alphanumeric text (using an LPR library or API). This reduces human error and ensures accurate records of all vehicles in the lot

. The system can automatically flag unrecognized or unauthorized plates for follow-up
surveillancesecure.com
, improving enforcement efficiency.
Image Capture (Plate & Vehicle): For each detection, capture two photos: a cropped close-up of the license plate (for clear OCR and evidence) and a wide shot of the entire vehicle. The app should either automatically crop the plate region or let the user adjust the crop after capture. These images provide context (vehicle make/model/color) alongside the plate number, aiding in vehicle identification during reviews.
GPS Location & Timestamp: Record the GPS coordinates of where each vehicle is spotted using the phone’s location services. Along with the date and time of capture, this metadata is saved for every entry. This allows auditors to see where and when each car was observed, useful for large lots or multiple parking zones. Entries in the log will include: Plate number, Location (lat/long or address if possible), Timestamp, and image links.
Data Logging to Cloud (Google Sheets/Database): Automatically log all data to a central source for access on other devices. A convenient method is using the Google Sheets API to append each entry (plate text, timestamp, GPS, image URLs) as a new row in a spreadsheet, which serves as a cloud database. This ensures records are instantly available for management and can be easily filtered or exported. (Alternatively, use a dedicated database and provide a desktop web dashboard to view the data.) The cloud log allows further analysis and prevents data loss if the device is lost.
Desktop Dashboard & Reporting: Provide a secure desktop web interface (or simply rely on the Google Sheet) for managers to review and manage the parking logs. This interface should allow viewing all captured entries, searching by license plate or date, and adding notes or comments to each entry (e.g. “Vehicle belongs to VIP guest” or “Warning issued on 9/25”). Include reporting functions such as generating summaries (e.g. total unique cars, repeat offenders, occupancy rates over time) and exporting data (CSV or PDF). Managers can use this to identify frequent violators or analyze parking lot usage trends.
Cross-Platform Implementation: Build as a Progressive Web App (PWA) so it works on any smartphone (iOS/Android) and modern browsers without separate native apps. The UI should be mobile-responsive and touch-friendly. Leveraging web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript with a framework like React or Vue) ensures the app can be “installed” to a home screen and even used offline if needed. The PWA can use camera access (via HTML media capture or Web APIs) to take photos and can cache data locally when offline, syncing to the cloud when back online.
User Authentication & Security: Implement a simple login system so that only authorized staff can use the app and view the data. Each scan entry could record the user ID of who performed it, for accountability. All data transmission should be over HTTPS, and sensitive data (like license plate numbers and images) must be stored securely. Consider privacy implications: license plates are personally identifiable information, so ensure compliance with any relevant data protection regulations (e.g. GDPR) and purge data that's no longer needed

Additional Industry-Standard Features
In addition to core requirements, the app can include extra features to meet industry best practices for parking management

:
Whitelist of Authorized Vehicles: Allow the system to maintain a list of approved license plates (e.g. registered hotel guests, staff, VIPs). When a plate is scanned, the app can cross-check against this whitelist. If the plate is on the list, it might tag the entry as “✅ Authorized”; if not, mark it as “❌ Unrecognized” or potential violation. This makes it easy to identify vehicles that shouldn’t be there, as the system can automatically flag unregistered vehicles and alert staff accordingly
surveillancesecure.com
. The app should allow importing or inputting known plate numbers (from guest registrations or employee permits) and possibly a blacklist for banned vehicles.
Alerts & Notifications: Implement real-time alerts for certain conditions. For example, if a blacklisted or previously flagged license plate is detected, the app can notify the user immediately with an alert (sound or vibration) so they can take action. Notifications could also be used if a vehicle has been recorded multiple times over a period (indicating it’s been parked for a long duration or returned frequently). This helps catch repeat violators quickly. If using a backend, push notifications or emails could be sent to managers for serious violations.
Violation Handling (Citations & Towing): To aid enforcement, build in workflows for handling unauthorized vehicles. For instance, after logging an unauthorized car, the user can tap an option to issue a citation or warning. This could generate a digital citation record in the system (and even print or email a notice to place on the vehicle). Another option is a “Call Tow Truck” button which brings up the phone dialer with the towing company’s number, streamlining the removal process

. Integrating these actions into the app ensures that once a violator is identified via LPR, appropriate next steps can be taken quickly (as some commercial parking apps do allow issuing digital tickets and contacting towing services

).
Search & History Lookup: Provide a search function in the app or dashboard to lookup a specific license plate and see history of when/where it was spotted. This is useful for investigations – e.g. if a problem vehicle is reported, staff can quickly find all instances of that plate in the logs. They could see that “ABC-1234” was logged 3 times this week in different spots, etc. Efficient search helps in analyzing patterns (like a non-guest car regularly using the lot).
Analytics & Reporting: Beyond raw data, include an analytics view for aggregated insights. For example, show the number of unique vehicles logged per day, average occupancy (if the lot capacity is known), peak times when most cars are present, and how many violations (unauthorized cars) occur per week. Advanced analytics might include identifying frequent violators or how long cars stay (if multiple rounds of scans are done). These statistics help hotel management optimize parking policies and demonstrate the effectiveness of the audit program

.
Multi-User and Multi-Lot Support: If needed, the app can support multiple users (each auditor with their own login) and even multiple parking lots or zones. For a hotel property with separate parking areas (e.g. front lot, garage, overflow lot), the app could let the user select or automatically detect which zone they are auditing. Data logs can then include the zone, and reports can be filtered by location. Multi-user support with role-based access (e.g. regular officer vs. manager) is useful for larger teams, ensuring only managers can delete entries or view certain reports, etc.
Offline Mode: Since parking lot audits may be done in areas with weak connectivity, the app should ideally work offline. Using PWA capabilities, it can store captured entries locally if no internet is available, and then sync with the Google Sheet/cloud once back online. This prevents data loss and allows continuous use even when connectivity is spotty.
Ease of Use & Guidance: Include UI cues to assist users in capturing good photos. For example, an on-screen frame or augmented overlay to align the license plate, and a feedback message if no plate is detected. The app might use the phone’s flashlight for nighttime capture. Providing quick feedback on the OCR result (display the recognized plate text on screen) lets the user verify correctness. If the OCR confidence is low, allow the user to edit the plate number manually before saving, to ensure accuracy of the logged data.
Integration Capabilities: Design the system with flexibility to integrate with other platforms. For instance, if the hotel has a guest management or permit database, the app could interface with it to automatically fetch the day’s expected guest vehicles or to log violations into a security incident system. The data output (e.g. the Google Sheet or CSV) should be in a format that can be easily used in other software. Maintaining an open integration approach (e.g. RESTful API or webhooks) makes the solution more powerful and in line with industry systems

. For example, an API could allow the hotel’s front-desk software to add a guest’s plate to the whitelist when they check in.
